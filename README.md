# Showoff

Showoff is a project that aims to create a community website for Mozilla
contributors where they can showoff their community achievements.

Showoff makes use of [Open Badges](http://openbadges.org/) and makes it really
simple to issue badges, hence trying to solve the problem of recognizing
community achievements even at local levels.

**Note:** This project is only an early prototype.

## TODO

* Resstart this project with using Mozilla's Django template [Playdoh](http://github.com/mozilla/playdoh)].
